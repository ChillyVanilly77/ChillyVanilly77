- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChillyVanilly77
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms, programming languages, building cool stuff with modern tech, K8s/OpenShift/etc, and much much more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit more lower level things about OS, Rust and Kotlin
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects be it small or bit. I would like to get more into Fuchsia in the near future!

- 💻 I am familiar with ...
  - the Gradle build & dependency tool
  - container orchestrator tools such as Kubernetes and OpenShift
  - OCI (a.k.a "Docker") images and how to build them (even within the OpenShift platform)
