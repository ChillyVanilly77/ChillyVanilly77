- 👋 Hi, I’m Chilly!
- 👀 I’m interested in building plenty of things, such as systems, tools and much much more with modern programming languages & tech!
- 🌱 I’m always learning something new! Almost every day!
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on interesting projects, be it small or large!
- 📫 Your can reach me via here, by E-Mail or via Discord `Chilly_Vanilly#7099`
- 💻 I am familiar with ...
  - container orchestrator tools such as Kubernetes and OpenShift
  - OCI (a.k.a "Docker") images and how to build them (even within the OpenShift platform) which sorta implies
    familiarity also with how Linux works etc
  - the programming languages Rust, C++, Kotlin, Python, Groovy, Java, TypeScript (and JS although I very much prefer TS over JS)
  - the "web trio" (JS + (S)CSS + HTML)
